## Introduction

Welcome to the 3D Printed Manual Transmission Model project! This project provides the design files and instructions to create a fully functional model of a manual transmission using 3D printing technology. The model demonstrates the inner workings of a real manual transmission, allowing enthusiasts and students to understand and visualize its mechanics.

## Features

- Detailed and accurate representation of a manual transmission.
- Fully functional gear shifting mechanism.
- Designed for easy 3D printing and assembly.
- Educational tool for learning and teaching automotive mechanics.

## Bill of Materials

- 3D printed parts (STL files provided)
- Bearings
- Shafts
- Gears
- Screws and nuts
- Springs

A detailed list of required hardware and quantities can be found in the `BOM.md` file in the repository.

## 3D Printing Instructions

1. Download the STL files from the `STL_Files` directory.
2. Use your preferred slicing software to prepare the files for your 3D printer.
3. Recommended print settings:
   - Layer height: 0.2mm
   - Infill: 20%
   - Supports: Yes (where necessary)
4. Print the parts using PLA or ABS filament for best results.

## Assembly Instructions

Follow these steps to assemble the 3D printed manual transmission model:

1. **Prepare Parts:** Clean and smooth all 3D printed parts. Ensure all support material is removed.
2. **Install Bearings:** Press fit the bearings into their respective slots in the printed parts.
3. **Assemble Gears:** Place the gears onto the shafts and secure them using screws and nuts.
4. **Combine Subassemblies:** Follow the detailed assembly guide provided in the `Assembly_Guide.md` to combine all subassemblies into the final transmission model.
5. **Final Adjustments:** Check for smooth operation and make any necessary adjustments.

For a step-by-step visual guide, refer to the `Assembly_Guide.md` file in the repository.

## Operation

Once assembled, the manual transmission model can be operated by:

- Shifting the gears using the gear stick.
- Rotating the input shaft to see the output shaft move in different gear ratios.
- Observing the engagement and disengagement of gears.

This model is an excellent tool for demonstrating the principles of manual transmission systems.
